# LinkedIn Connection Automator - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automates LinkedIn connection requests with sequential processing, random delays, and safety features.

## Features

- **Sequential Processing**: Processes prospects one at a time in the exact order they appear
- **Page Navigation**: Automatically moves between search result pages
- **Random Delays**: Includes safety delays to avoid detection
- **Index Tracking**: Maintains prospect order within each page
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple popup to start/stop automation

## Installation

### Method 1: From Source Code

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Build the extension**: `npm run build`
4. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle in top right)
6. **Click "Load unpacked"**
7. **Select the `dist` folder** (not the root folder)
8. **The extension will appear** in your extensions list

### Method 2: From Chrome Web Store (if published)

1. Visit the extension page on Chrome Web Store
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Confirm installation

## Usage

1. **Navigate** to a LinkedIn search results page
2. **Click the extension icon** in Chrome toolbar
3. **Check for updates** (automatic when popup opens)

**Note**: Load the `dist/` folder in Chrome, not the root folder.

## How It Works

### Sequential Processing
- Captures all prospects on the current page into a list
- Processes prospects by index (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- Each prospect must complete fully before the next starts
- Resets the list only when navigating to a new page

### Safety Features
- Random delays between actions (500-5500ms)
- Respects LinkedIn's UI timing
- Processes one connection at a time
- Includes error handling and timeouts

### Page Navigation
- Automatically detects "Next" page button
- Waits for new page to load completely
- Resets prospect index for each new page
- Continues until no more pages exist

## Permissions

The extension requires:
- `activeTab`: To interact with the current LinkedIn tab
- `storage`: To save settings (future feature)
- Host permission for `https://www.linkedin.com/*`: To run on LinkedIn pages

## Development

### TypeScript Setup

This project is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. The TypeScript source files are in the `src/` directory, and the compiled output goes to the `dist/` directory.

#### Building the Extension

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension (compile TypeScript and copy assets)
npm run build

# Clean the dist folder
npm run clean

# Watch mode (auto-compile on file changes)
npm run watch
```

The build process:
1. Compiles TypeScript files from `src/` to JavaScript in `dist/`
2. Copies `popup.html` and `manifest.json` to `dist/`
3. The `dist/` folder contains the complete, loadable Chrome extension

#### Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist/` folder (not the root folder)
6. The extension will appear in your extensions list

#### TypeScript Configuration

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript compiler configuration
- **Target**: ES2020 for modern JavaScript features
- **Strict mode**: Enabled for better type safety
- **Types**: Chrome extension APIs via `@types/chrome`

#### Type Annotations

The codebase uses TypeScript type annotations without changing any business logic:
- Interface definitions for message settings and other data structures
- Type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Type safety for DOM elements and Chrome API calls
- `@ts-expect-error` comments for non-standard browser APIs (like Trusted Types)

### Adding Icons

Create PNG icons in these sizes and place them in the extension folder:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

### Testing

1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Navigate to LinkedIn search results
3. Open browser console to see logs
4. Start automation and monitor progress

### Building for Production

1. Remove any development files
2. Ensure all icon files are present
3. Test thoroughly on different LinkedIn pages
4. Create a ZIP file for Chrome Web Store submission

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?
- Ensure you're on a LinkedIn search results page
- Check that the content script loaded (console logs)
- Verify all permissions are granted

### Automation not starting?
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure you're on the correct LinkedIn URL pattern
- Try refreshing the page and reloading the extension

### Performance issues?
- Increase delay multipliers in the code
- Process fewer prospects per session
- Take breaks between automation sessions
